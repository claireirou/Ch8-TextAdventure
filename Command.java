/**
 * This class is part of the "Mansion Detective" application. 
 * "Mansion Detective" is a text based murder myster adventure game.  
 *
 * This class holds information about a command that was issued by the user.
 * A command currently consists of up to four parts: a CommandWord and a series of strings
 * (for example, if the command was "take old map", then the three parts
 * are TAKE and "old" and "map").
 * 
 * The way this is used is: Commands are already checked for being valid
 * command words. If the user entered an invalid command (a word that is not
 * known) then the CommandWord is UNKNOWN.
 *
 * If the command had only one word, then the second, third and fourth
 * words are <null>.
