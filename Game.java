/**
 *  This class is the main class of the "Mansion Detective" application. 
 *  "Mansion Detective" is a text based murder mystery game.  Players need 
 *  to find the body and the murder weapon to win.
 * 
 *  To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play"
 *  method.
 * 
 *  This main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all
 *  rooms, items, and people, and creates the parser and starts the game.  
 *  It also evaluates and executes the commands that the parser returns.
